# tellybox

Tellybox does the following in a lightweight client
* tells you how much sab has left to download
* sets limits on the sab downloader
* allows you to grab missed episodes from sickbeard either from the latest season or specific seasons

Tellybox was invented because in my house sab and sick run on a machine so slow the web client on either takes forever to load, so this just does the simple API calls and only the required information is sent with no rendering required.
